      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to Jelmer's Easy Style system. I have written this Style System
        so you can quickly make any webpage look consistent and good without
        having an overkill on features. Keeping its footprint low. And I
        separated theming. Which means colours, borders, box-shadows, fonts and
        the like can be adjusted super easy.
      </p>
      <h2>Features</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Out-of-the-box responsive</li>
        <li>A lot of layout variations</li>
        <li>Semantic classes and use of HTML5 elements</li>
        <li>Based on Microsoft Fluent Design.</li>
        <li>Allows for easy theming.</li>
        <li>Built with Less, so you can easily modify inside a webbrowser.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What it is not</h2>
      <p>
        It was not intented to be a 100% complete library. Just to get 80 - 90%
        of all the heavy lifting out of the way so you can add your own CSS as
        you see fit.
