        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>
          I have written this Style System so you can quickly make any webpage
          look consistent and good without having an overkill on features.
          <br />
          Keeping its footprint low. And I separated theming. Which means
          colours, borders, box-shadows, fonts and the like can be adjusted
          super easy.
        </p>
        <h2>Features</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Out-of-the-box responsive</li>
          <li>A lot of layout variations</li>
          <li>Semantic classes and use of HTML5 elements</li>
          <li>Based on Microsoft Fluent Design.</li>
          <li>Allows for easy theming.</li>
          <li>
            Built with Less, so you can easily modify inside a webbrowser.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What it is not</h2>
        <p>
          It was not intended to be a 100% complete library. Just to get 80 -
          90% of all the heavy lifting out of the way so you can add your own
          CSS as you see fit.
