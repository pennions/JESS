      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>
        I have written this Style System so you can quickly make any webpage
        look consistent and good without having an overkill on features.
        <br />
        Keeping its footprint low. And I separated theming. Which means colours,
        borders, box-shadows, fonts and the like can be adjusted super easy.
      </p>
      <h2>Features</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Out-of-the-box responsive</li>
        <li>A lot of layout variations</li>
        <li>Semantic classes and use of HTML5 elements</li>
        <li>Based on Microsoft Fluent Design.</li>
        <li>Allows for easy theming.</li>
        <li>Built with Less, so you can easily modify inside a webbrowser.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>
        My goal is to make the life of fullstack webapplication developers
        easier by providing a lot of things out-of-the-box <br />
        so they can focus on the business logic and add value instantly.
