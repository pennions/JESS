# Welcome to Jelmer's Easy Style system!

I have written this Style System
so you can quickly make any webpage look consistent and good without
having an overkill on features. Keeping its footprint low. And I
separated theming. Which means colours, borders, box-shadows, fonts and
the like can be adjusted super easy.

## Features

- Out-of-the-box responsive
- A lot of layout variations
- Makes use of HTML5 elements
- Based on Microsoft Fluent Design.
- Allows for easy theming.
- Built with Less, so you can easily modify inside a webbrowser.

## Goal
My goal is to make the life of fullstack webapplication developers easier by providing a lot of things out-of-the-box <br />
so they can focus on the business logic and add value instantly.
