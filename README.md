# Welcome!

Welcome to Jelmer's Easy Style system. I have written this Style System
so you can quickly make any webpage look consistent and good without
having an overkill on features. Keeping its footprint low. And I
separated theming. Which means colours, borders, box-shadows, fonts and
the like can be adjusted super easy.

## Features

- Out-of-the-box responsive
- A lot of layout variations
- Semantic classes and use of HTML5 elements
- Based on Microsoft Fluent Design.
- Allows for easy theming.
- Built with Less, so you can easily modify inside a webbrowser.

## What it is not

It was not intented to be a 100% complete library. Just to get 80 -
90% of all the heavy lifting out of the way so you can add your own CSS
as you see fit.
